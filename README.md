# MNIST-Classification-using-LeNet-CNN
Classification using ANN was inefficient because:
1. Large number of Parameters (of the order of 100k)
2. 2-D information was not used as flattened pixels were the inputs
3. Would have worked poorly if relevant objects in images werent centred

Advantages of CNN:-
1. Number of parameters almost halved (of the order of 60k)
2. 2D information was used.
3. kernels focus on neighbouring pixels which helps in learning patterns regardless of the object's position on image.
